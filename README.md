Project Overview
Malaria is a life-threatening disease caused by parasites transmitted through the bites of infected female Anopheles mosquitoes. Early and accurate detection is crucial for effective treatment and control. This project aims to build a deep learning model to detect malaria-infected cells from microscopic images.

Dataset
The dataset used for this project is the "Malaria Cell Images Dataset," which consists of 27,558 images of both parasitized and uninfected cells.
